/ remarks: there's no input sanitation. 
/ ugly stuff will happen if, second half-word > 077, or tape doesn't
/ start with address word, or there's no address word before a data-
/ word.
/ also no provisioning for end-of-tape.
/ however, if the last address/data combo is 7775/JMP somewhere
/ or 7775/HLT it will do just that instead of waiting for the next
/ character
